Introduction
	This lab was meant to allow students to apply the skills they have picked up with programming to bash script. We were to practice bash scripting by using the Git-Bash terminal we used in the first project for this class, as well as using text editor nano. We were given a guide meant as a tutorial for bash scripting to use and work through as we demonstrated our abilities to work with bash scripting and while applying what we have learned in the past about coding in general. While doing this, we were to also document our work, push our changes onto a repository created on GitHub, where we were to then share our scripts with someone else, and finally we were to submit our repository link from GitHub. 
Process
	It took me a while to figure out how I should start this assignment. I had heard that using a Linux virtual machine would be easier to follow along with for the purpose of this lab. I set one up and everything, but I came into some issues regarding GitHub. I decided to just stick it out with the Git Bash terminal we installed from the last project and work from there. Once I was situated, I used my memory from project one to create a new repository and link it from the GitHub website to the work I was doing on my terminal. When my environment was properly set up, I began my work on the steps outlined by the bash scripting guide. The first step was easy, as it just had us test out some of the features of the shell, features we were already familiar with, like “ls”, “date”, “pwd” and “cal”. The guide moved on to scripting, in which we created a document, “task.sh”, and wrote out commands in it so that by executing the task.sh document, we could run the commands from above all at once, rather than running them separately. Scripting makes it easy to automate processes like this. Unfortunately, the “cal” command does not work in the git bash terminal I was working in, and while I was looking for the right command to accomplish the same thing, I couldn’t find a fix for this. Following the scripting tutorial, we were then introduced to how bash works. We did this by opening up our task.sh file, and writing in “#!/bin/bash”. This is to define the shell interpreter that you want to use to interpret any script. While ours did it automatically, without defining the shell interpreter, it is a good practice to do so. We then moved on to file names and permissions. To start this step, I first began by creating a file named “hello-world.sh”, and then using the command “file hello-world.sh”, which would give me the information of the file, such as if it is a “Bourne-Again shell script” or if it has ASCII text. Next, I copied the "hello-world.sh" file to a new file, which i named "0_xvz". I modified the text using the nano editor to remove the "#!/bin/bash" line from the file, and again used the command "file" on the newly created file. This time, It only showed "ASCII text", rather than displaying the shell or any other information besides text. The next step involved Script Execution. This step involved using the echo command to write the text "date" to a file also named date.sh, and then making it so that the file could run. Originally, the file should not be able to run with just the command "./date.sh". I believe mine worked just fine using the git bash terminal, but i followed along anyway. I used the nano editor to write in the shebang (#!/bin/bash). Then, I used the "chmod +x" command to make the file executable. Doing these steps would help to make a file execute in a linux terminal. By completing these steps, the date.sh file would execute and show the current date. Next, we moved on to work with Relative and Absolute Paths. This was a very simple step that involved navigating through the terminal using the cd commands and either absolute paths that would take us to a certain directory, or relative paths which would take us to another nearby part instead of typing the entire absolute path again. Moving on to the next step, I deleted my old "hello-world.sh" file and made a mew
