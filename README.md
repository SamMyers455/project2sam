This lab was meant to allow students to apply the skills they have picked up with programming to bash script. We were to practice bash scripting by using the Git-Bash terminal we used in the first project for this class, as well as using text editor nano. We were given a guide meant as a tutorial for bash scripting to use and work through as we demonstrated our abilities to work with bash scripting and while applying what we have learned in the past about coding in general. While doing this, we were to also document our work, push our changes onto a repository created on GitHub, where we were to then share our scripts with someone else, and finally we were to submit our repository link from GitHub.
